everblog_ruby
=============

This is the ruby version of the project `everblog`_.

.. _`everblog`: https://github.com/tylerlong/everblog

The everblog project is originally written in Python. Later I decided to rewrite it in Ruby just for learning purpose.

Well, it's not an exact clone of the Python version. I have learnt a lot of best practices for web development recently. So, technically speaking, the Ruby version will be more elegant than the Python version.
